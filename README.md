# Automated Deep Learning Approach for Nucleus Segmentation in Fluorescence LEXY Videos

Nucleus segmentation in fluorescence microscopy is crucial for studying nucleocytoplasmic transport, particularly with optogenetic systems like LEXY (light-inducible nuclear export). LEXY allows precise, reversible control of nuclear protein export via irradiation, but videos of cells expressing LEXY present significant segmentation challenges. As irradiation progresses, the nuclear-cytoplasmic contrast diminishes, leading to frames where the nucleus becomes difficult or impossible to distinguish from the cytosol. To address these challenges, an automated deep learning approach is proposed that integrates temporal information to enhance segmentation accuracy in these challenging fluorescence LEXY videos. Using pretraining on the large, high-quality Human Protein Atlas (HPA) dataset, I evaluated U-Net and two architectures, Track-Net and Siam-Net, which incorporate the previous frame mask and a reference frame and mask, respectively. Given the heterogeneity of the LEXY dataset, which contains only 10 videos, I generated synthetic videos from HPA data designed to mimic LEXY conditions. On these synthetic sequences, Track-Net and Siam-Net exhibited significant error propagation over time, resulting in poor segmentation performance. In contrast, the base U-Net model produced more consistent, though still suboptimal, predictions. Testing the base U-Net on the actual LEXY dataset showed that pretraining on HPA improved segmentation, achieving a Dice score of 0.55. It is clear that more training data and exploration of alternative architectures is needed to fully address the segmentation challenges posed by LEXY videos.
